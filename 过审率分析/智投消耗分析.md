智投消耗分析
================

注意在`campaign`中`day_budget=0`的是预算不限的情况

    campaign.budget_type=1 不限预算
    campaign.budget_type=2 统一预算
    campaign.budget_type=3 每日预算

| budget\_type | 数量     |
| :----------- | :----- |
| 1            | 566355 |
| 2            | 51771  |
| 3            | 2720   |

``` sql
select a.date as date
      , a.company_id
      , cost
      , day_budget
      , cost / day_budget as cost_rate
     -- , sum(day_budget) as day_budget
     -- , sum(cost) as cost
from (
select date
     , company_id
     , sum(cost) as cost
from  makepolo.creative_report
where create_channel =1
group by 1, 2
) a left join (
select date_format(create_time,'%Y-%m-%d') as date
     ,company_id
     ,sum(day_budget) as day_budget
from makepolo.campaign
where day_budget>0
group by 1,2
-- order by 1 desc
)budget on budget.company_id = a.company_id and budget.date = a.date
where day_budget>0 -- 筛选预算>0的
```

从以上代码发现，消耗远大于预算。下面不分日期查询，而是筛选一段较长的时间。

``` sql
select a.company_id
      , cost
      , day_budget
      , cost / day_budget as cost_rate
from (
select company_id
     , sum(cost) as cost
from  makepolo.creative_report
where create_channel =1   and date>='2020-09-07'
  and date<='2020-10-13'
group by 1
) a left join (
select company_id
     ,sum(day_budget) as day_budget
from makepolo.campaign
where day_budget>0
  and create_time>='2020-09-07 00:00:00'
  and create_time<='2020-10-13 23:59:59'
group by 1
-- order by 1 desc
)budget on budget.company_id = a.company_id
where day_budget>0
```

消耗仍然远大于预算。原因是有些公司可能不限预算。

下面使用`vendor_campaign_id`来进行聚合。

``` sql
select a.vendor_campaign_id
      , cost
      , day_budget
      , cost / day_budget as cost_rate
from (
select vendor_campaign_id
     , sum(cost) as cost
from  makepolo.creative_report
where create_channel =1 and date>='2020-10-13'
  and date<='2020-10-13'
group by 1
) a left join (
select vendor_campaign_id
     ,sum(day_budget) as day_budget
from makepolo.campaign
where day_budget>0
  and create_time>='2020-10-13 00:00:00'
  and create_time<='2020-10-13 23:59:59'
group by 1
-- order by 1 desc
)budget on budget.vendor_campaign_id = a.vendor_campaign_id
where day_budget>0
```

发现消耗远小于预算。
